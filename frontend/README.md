## Completion Instructions

### Functionality

#### Must Have

      1. Build a web application to search Brewery by City using Brewery APIs
          (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation) and add reviews. This web app
          should have sign-up for new users and login for existing users.
      2. When a user logs in, the home page should have a Brewery search option. This
          search option should be able to search by_city, by_name, and by_type (Read
          API docs to see what by_city, by_name, and by_type means).
      3. The search result should display at least the following details per Brewery:
          a. Brewery name
          b. Brewery Address
          c. Phone number
          d. Web site URL
          e. Current rating (rating based on point no.4)
          f. State, City
      4. When the user clicks on a Brewery, the new page should open with all possible
          Brewery information. The user should have the ability to add reviews for a
          Brewery, and this should be saved in a hosted database that you will host to
          complete this exercise. Whenever someone opens a brewery page, the reviews
          should also be shown on the brewery info page. You should be storing the new
          reviews given by the user in your database and show them in the info page when
          it opens.
      5. The review should contain a rating from 1-5 and a description.
